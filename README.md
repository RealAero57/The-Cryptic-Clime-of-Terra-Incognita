# The-Cryptic-Clime-of-Terra-Incognita
A weird alien story thingy with lots of compsci refernces. 


BTW, the charecters DO NOT resemble anyone from real life. If they do its just pure coincidence. And also, this goes without saying, DO NOT visit any link posted in this repo. Also any damages caused to you from this isnt our resposibility


This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, places, incidents and events, corporations, establishments, countries, governments, etc. either are products of the authorâ€™s imagination or are used fictitiously. Any resemblance to actual events or locales or persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.
