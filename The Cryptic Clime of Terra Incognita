# <u>The Cryptic Clime of Terra Incognita<u>

On the 27th of July 2008, user WalterMelon of the popular internet forum int4, posted a post thread in the subforum int4.comp.int. Crypt(ic) website it was titled. 
>“I found this weird website on the interwebs. The address is cryptic.crpyt. It uses a TLD that 	doesn’t exist. How every odd. The only text I can see there are weird symbols, which seem 	neither to be Unicode characters nor a weird wingdings/dingbat font—in fact, when I 	checked the inspector for the font, it just shows it in the same weird characters. I’ve checked 	my entire network for any references for this font and there seem to be none. The symbols 	don’t seem random, they seem to be arranged in a specific pattern, maybe like a language, 	maybe like the Voynich Manuscript. That’s all I know. I have posted it here since it seems pretty intriguing.”

it read. The thread blew up within the subforum and not before long many people had started replying on the thread. “I used a program to find the ip address and rough location of the server. I got nothing back. I’ve even tried to find the ping to (rather roughly) find the aprox. Position of the server. I get no ping back, yet the website does seem extremely responsive. This is very odd indeed. Could this be a secret from the government? Probably not, ‘cause why would they use the www? Maybe it’s a prank, but if that is the case, how did they manage to mask ip addresses?” replied user Lewiskool99.
